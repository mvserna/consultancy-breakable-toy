# TODO

- Find a way to include root's vscode settings in server/client folders' vscode settings
- Verify that factories are working correctly (Kerrin encountered empty squids ðŸ˜±)
- Make "differences from curriculum Engage"
- Add GitHub CI
- Create root-level eslint config and remove root=true for subdir-level configs

## Differences from Curriculum Engage draft

- We don't have a command to access the repl -- we want to encourage console.log debugging and seed-file-writing, as it's more efficient
- Commands should be run from within server and client, not at the root
