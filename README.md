# Consultancy Breakable Toy

Welcome to your breakable toy! To get started,

1. Fork this repo
2. Skim through the rest of this README and the potential user stories in [`USER_STORIES.md`](USER_STORIES.md)
3. Meet with your mentor to choose which stories are most appropriate. Together, create Shortcut stories for these user stories and add deadlines and estimates.
4. Code! Be sure to follow the consulting workflow (described elsewhere)

You may choose your own theme as long as it satisfies the goals of each user story. However, time is of the essence, so avoid getting overly creative (at the expense of coding time). A possible theme is provided below.

## Theme

You will implement an app themed around _Squid Games_, as devised by someone who has never seen that TV show. Your app will track all your squids: their names, breeds, special powers, etc.

## Breakable Toy Goals

1. Become familiar with key technologies used in the consultancy
2. Assemble a resource for yourself to refer back to -- don't be afraid to add comments that will help you catch back up to speed later! You will not be penalized for comments or intentionally commented-out code during PR review.
3. Provide a sandbox in the future for experimenting with other, more advanced tools (see, e.g., the Advanced user stories)

## Other Requirements and Notes

- Write Jest tests for your methods and any helper functions
- Write tests for any simple custom hooks using React Testing Library Custom Hooks package
- Style your pages using Tailwind and BEM convention... but don't get too caught up on design. We want to make sure that you can apply basic Tailwind styles and understand the BEM approach
